## Design Choices

### Fonts 

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") 

This project utilizes Google Fonts, specifically the Inter font, to ensure a consistent and cohesive appearance across all pages. By using a single font, we aim to maintain a unified design aesthetic, minimizing distractions and enhancing readability for users. The simplicity of Inter supports a clean and professional look, allowing the content to take center stage.


### Colours

A variety of colors has been employed throughout the project to create an engaging and vibrant visual experience. Careful consideration was given to ensure that the colors complement each other, providing a harmonious and soothing aesthetic. This approach was chosen to enhance the overall user experience, allowing the design to be visually appealing without being overwhelming or distracting.

![Colour Palette](docs/screenshots/colours.png)

* #FFFDD0 - To provide a harmonious contrast, the color FFFDD0, a soft cream, is used to divide the Goldenrod background in the middle, offering an appealing backdrop for the central content. On the "Best Scores" page, while the Goldenrod spans the entire page, FFFDD0 is featured as the background color for the "best of the best" container in the center, enhancing its prominence and providing a visually pleasing highlight against the Goldenrod.

* #DFF2D8 - The color #DFF2D8 was utilized as the background for the answers container, providing a gentle and soft backdrop.

* #222 - The color #222 was selected for the page font, offering a sleek and modern look that ensures readability and complements the overall design.

* #17A2B8 - The color #17A2B8 has been used for all the buttons throughout the project, adding a vibrant and inviting touch that enhances user interaction and complements the site's overall aesthetic.

* #FFFFFF - The color #FFFFFF was used for the fonts inside the buttons, providing clear and crisp contrast against the button color for optimal readability.

* #F0B27A - The color #F0B27A was used as the background color for the option letters A, B, C, D, and E, offering a warm and inviting look that distinguishes the options clearly.

* #90EE90 - The color #90EE90 was used to indicate when a user answers a question correctly, providing a pleasant and positive visual feedback.

* #FF7F7F - The color #FF7F7F was used to highlight when a user answers a question incorrectly, offering a clear and immediate visual cue.


* * Note - The colors mentioned—#FFFDD0, #222, #17A2B8, #FFFFFF, #F0B27A, #90EE90, and #FF7F7F—are the most prominent within the project and are clearly visible throughout the design, playing a key role in shaping the user experience. While these are the main colors used, there might be some colors that I inadvertently 
forgot to mention.


### Structure

* The quiz site consists of three main pages, or four if we include the "Best of Best Scores" page. The first page is the welcome page, featuring motivational text that explains the benefits and enjoyment of taking quizzes. This page also contains two buttons: one to start the game and another to view the top scores. Once the "Play" button is pressed, users are taken to the second page, where they can begin answering questions. This page includes a question counter and a score counter. After all questions have been answered, users proceed to the third page. The third page provides humorous text, along with buttons for "Home Page" and "Retry," allowing users to play again and aim to improve their scores. After entering their username and pressing the "Save" button to save their score, users are automatically redirected to the main page. A fourth page is accessible via the "Best Scores" button on the main page.



## Features

### Favicon

### Lighthouse Testing

* Mobile Lighthouse Testing :

![Mobile Lighthouse result](docs/screenshots/mobiletest.png)

* Desktop Lighthouse Testing :

![Desktop Lighthouse result](docs/screenshots/desktoptest.png)

## Note :

* The website underwent Lighthouse testing for both desktop and mobile versions. It achieved high scores across most categories, with a 90% score specifically in the SEO section for both platforms. This demonstrates strong search engine optimization practices.

The 10% deduction in the SEO score is due to minor suggestions:

1. A potentially malformed robots.txt file
2. Some missing image alt attributes
3. Absence of a canonical link

These issues don't significantly impact the website's search engine performance or user experience. They're optimization suggestions rather than critical problems. Given the high SEO score for both desktop and mobile, the current implementation successfully meets SEO requirements while leaving room for future fine-tuning if deemed necessary.



#### JavaScript Testing

- The JavaScript code has been validated using [JSHint](https://jshint.com/ "JSHint") and produced the following results.

* script.js and final.js files :

![JSHint result](docs/screenshots/scriptjs.png)
![JSHint result](docs/screenshots/finaljs.png)

- JSHint Warnings and Code Metrics Explained

When you run JSHint on this project, you might see warnings about ES6 features. Don't worry – these aren't errors in your code. They just show that we're using modern JavaScript.

These warnings mention things like 'const', 'let', arrow functions (=>), and the spread operator (...). All of these are part of ES6, which is a newer version of JavaScript.

JSHint is telling us that we're using these new features. If you're building for modern browsers or recent versions of Node.js, you can ignore these warnings. Your code will work fine.

Important Note: Despite these warnings, the code is functioning correctly and as intended. There's no need for intervention or changes based on these JSHint warnings alone. The code is working well in its current state.

* bestscores.js file :

![JSHint result](docs/screenshots/bestscoresjs.png)

-When running JSHint on the project files, several warnings may appear:

"Expected an identifier and instead saw ''":
This typically occurs when CSS comments (/ */) are interpreted as JavaScript.

"Expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression" and "Missing semicolon":
These are also related to CSS being parsed as JavaScript.

"Unbegun comment":
This might indicate a malformed comment in a CSS file.

ES6-related warnings:

"'arrow function syntax (=>)' is only available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6')"
"'const' is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz)"
"'template literal syntax' is only available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6')" These indicate the use of modern JavaScript features.
Most of these warnings are due to JSHint attempting to parse CSS as JavaScript, which it's not designed to do. For the JavaScript-specific warnings, they're flagging the use of ES6 features.

Important Note: The code is functioning correctly despite these warnings. No intervention is needed, and these warnings do not affect the code's performance or functionality.

* Separate note for both texts:

Due to time constraints, it has been decided not to investigate these warnings further. The current code is working as intended, if more time was available, some research into fixing this issues would be done.


### WAVE Testing 

![WAVE Testing Result](docs/screenshots/wavetest.png)

## Note 

* The WAVE accessibility test identified two areas for potential improvement in the website: contrast issues and heading structure. These are important considerations for accessibility, but it's crucial to note that they do not critically impact the core functionality of the site.

Contrast: Some text elements have lower contrast with their backgrounds than recommended by accessibility guidelines. While this may affect readability for some users, particularly those with visual impairments, it does not prevent the site from functioning as intended.

Heading Structure: Some text that appears to be a heading is not marked up with proper heading tags (h1-h6). This doesn't affect how the content displays visually but may impact how screen readers interpret the page structure.

These issues are part of web accessibility best practices rather than critical errors. They don't break any features or prevent users from interacting with the site. The website remains fully functional and usable for the vast majority of visitors.

However, we acknowledge the importance of continuous improvement. While these aren't urgent fixes, they represent opportunities to enhance the site's accessibility in the future. If any functionality issues arise or if these minor accessibility points begin to affect user experience, they will be addressed promptly.

The focus has been on delivering a functional, engaging quiz experience, which has been successfully achieved. Future iterations of the site may incorporate these accessibility enhancements to further improve the user experience for all visitors."

This text acknowledges the issues while reassuring that they don't critically impact the site's functionality, and it indicates a commitment to addressing any actual functionality issues that might arise in the future.

#### Note to Read

* In this project, after encountering initial challenges, I adopted a different approach. Following extensive research, I decided to implement a strategy where I separated each component into distinct pages. This modular approach proved to be more efficient and helped reduce errors.

The project structure is as follows:

The index.html page, styled with style.css, serves as the main entry point.

The game functionality is contained in game.html, which uses play.css for styling and script.js for its interactive elements.

The final.html page, which utilizes styles from style.css, has its JavaScript logic in a separate file named final.js. This separation was implemented after encountering a bug that was hindering the proper functioning of the code.

A fourth page, bestscores.html, was created with its CSS elements integrated into the main style.css file. To maintain consistency and prevent potential issues, its JavaScript functionality was isolated in a separate bestscores.js file.

This modular approach, with separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for different components, emerged as a solution to bugs encountered during the coding process. I found that this method of organizing the project not only helped in reducing mistakes but also proved to be more efficient for development and debugging.

The decision to separate the code into several pages was a direct result of the challenges faced during the project's development. This approach allowed for better organization, easier troubleshooting, and improved overall code management.


### Images

- Used Image :

![Background image](assets/images/quizbrackground.jpeg)

- The background image was created using an AI image generator. It visually represents a quiz game, utilizing pastel colors that harmonize beautifully with the color scheme of the question and answer container on the page.


### Bugs

* I attempted to find bugs but did not encounter any. I tested all the buttons and features that I had planned for the game, and they all function as expected. I acknowledge that the page is not perfect and there is certainly room for improvement. However, due to time constraints, it will remain in its current state for now. If people enjoy the game and feedback is positive, the game can be expanded and improved by adding more sections.If any bugs do arise, they will be addressed and fixed immediately.
